      "In 2007 some CPPD members challenged the inefficiency in operation and supervision of private sector participation (PSP) in waste management by the Enugu State Waste Management Authority that rendered the system into only revenue collection and exploitation of the people without refuse collection and proper waste management. Following our protest letter to the agency/government, there was overhaul in the system resulting to the good sanitary condition of the state today. This feat achieved by some pioneer members of CPPD (and other challenging situations of poverty, injustices, conflicts and human insecurity) spurred the formation of the organsiation in 2008.",

      "In 2008 through CPPD’s peace role and intervention, a serious land dispute between Emeora Neke Community and Umuezeogbu Umualor Community of Enugu State of Nigeria, was non-violently resolved. This was at the auspices of the Traditional Rulers Council of Isi-Uzo Local Government Area through which CPPD has worked and which helped to get peace agreement signed by both parties on November 13, 2008. This CPPD’s role led to averting of bloody crisis between the two communities.",

Violence will be reproduced if they fester and the causes are not sufficiently rooted out.",
